# FormulaFrenzy

A python-based implementation of a competitive function guessing game (Mental Regression).

## Inspiration 

We wanted to create a math game for all ages that required no knowledge of theory before hand, purely a game of problem solving.

In math class, students usually find themselves plugging numbers into functions & formulas, but this game teaches you to constructing functions by finding patterns. 

## What it does 

Given a randomly generated table of values, the player must construct a function that satisfies the table (the difficulty of the problem can range from very easy to very hard). Our game then parses their input using a custom-made algorithm. 

## How We built it 

The parser algorithm, function generator, and websocket sever was all built using Python. The frontend was built using React JS.

## Challenges We ran into 

Creating the input checker/validator, linking our project together, keeping each other on the same page.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

Having deployed it! The design! The power of the algorithm! 

## What We learned

We learned a ton about websockets and React. We also improved our problem solving ability ;)
